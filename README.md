# Github-repo-finder
**GitHub Repo Finder** helps developers and learners easily discover relevant open-source projects. It simplifies GitHub search by allowing natural queries, filters results by stars, activity, and language, and provides quick summaries so users can find quality repos to learn from or build upon.
Upcoming features will allow users to copy the code required to clone,and run the project with a single click of a button... Stay tuned!

This project is still under construction...

I will be unavailable to make further commits until the 10th of December as a result of the NYSC orientation camp (21 days)
